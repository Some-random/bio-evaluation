You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The supplied sequence exactly matches a historical UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot record annotated as EC 3.2.1.8, endo-1,4-beta-xylanase. The cited EC assignment is computationally supported by a PROSITE rule, rather than established by the excerpts as a direct experimental assay.

Cited evidence: [H1](#evidence-h1), [H2](#evidence-h2), [H4](#evidence-h4).

### Reasoning versus lookup: reasoning-supported

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The N-terminal hydrophobic signal-peptide-like region and the subsequent compact, aromatic-rich sequence are consistent with a secreted fungal glycoside hydrolase. Its sequence pattern is consistent with a GH11-like endo-xylanase, which supports EC 3.2.1.8 over the alpha-glucosidase, methyltransferase, and oxidase choices.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> A direct activity assay or a protein-specific annotation would confirm the exact substrate specificity, but is not necessary for a defensible sequence-family-based choice among these options.

**Reason**

> The sequence offers a biologically meaningful family-level basis for selecting the xylanase option; this does not depend solely on recognizing the exact sequence or recalling its database entry.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The sequence supports a secreted xylanase interpretation, while the other options describe substantially different catalytic activities.

### Important caveats

- The sequence match is to a historical UniProtKB record; the current record's sequence differs.
- The matched record's EC assignment is supported by a computational PROSITE rule in the cited excerpts; those excerpts do not independently establish experimental validation.
- The author's exact source snapshot is unknown.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `G2X0L1`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current mismatch.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 60. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
- The current UniProt sequence differs from the supplied sequence; applicability of current annotation excerpts is qualified by that mismatch.
