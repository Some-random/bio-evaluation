```text
You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Active Site Prediction, which is to identify the key amino acid residues that form the active site of an enzyme. The active site is the specific region on the enzyme where a substrate binds and the chemical reaction is catalyzed. Based on the full protein sequence provided, you must select the option that correctly lists the amino acid residues (by their type and position) that constitute the enzyme's catalytic center.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The exact sequence matches the UniProt entry, which annotates position 1236 as an active site for beta-ketoacyl synthase activity. This is computational annotation based on a PROSITE-ProRule, not direct experimental confirmation.

Cited evidence: [C5](#evidence-c5), [H3](#evidence-h3).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence is a very large, modular polyketide synthase; general knowledge may suggest catalytic motifs, but does not by itself establish that residue 1236 is an active site for this activity.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific assignment of position 1236 to beta-ketoacyl synthase activity, which is supplied by the database annotation but not by the question input.

**Reason**

> Selecting the exact numbered residue and its assigned role depends on an item-specific annotation or equivalent protein-specific analysis. The reviewer-only source supports the key but was not available to the evaluated model.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The supplied reviewer evidence supports D among the listed options. It also annotates positions 1371 and 1411 for the same activity, but neither is an offered choice.

### Important caveats

- The annotation is computational and sequence-matched; it is not evidence of direct experimental validation.
- The protein has multiple annotated beta-ketoacyl synthase active-site positions, while each choice gives only one residue.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `B4ER97`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 80. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
