You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The supplied sequence exactly matches the UniProt entry for an Aspergillus fumigatus aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. UniProt assigns EC 1.2.1.11 and cites experimental evidence for both the enzyme annotation and its catalytic reaction. This supports choice D, while the database evidence is reviewer-only and was not available to the evaluated model.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [H2](#evidence-h2), [H5](#evidence-h5).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence may permit enzyme-family inference, but the input provides no organism, pathway, substrate, or reaction context that establishes the specific catalytic activity and complete EC number.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific assignment to aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and its reaction corresponding to EC 1.2.1.11.

**Reason**

> Choosing among these complete EC numbers requires identifying the particular enzyme activity, a fact not stated in the input. Recognizing the sequence or using a predictor would rely on protein-specific identification rather than a biological argument supplied by the question.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The cited sequence-matched annotation supports D; the evidence provided does not support another listed option.

### Important caveats

- The annotation cites experimental evidence, but the primary papers were not independently retrieved or validated here.
- The exact source snapshot used by the question author is unknown.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `Q4WWR8`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 118. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
