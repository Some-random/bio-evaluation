```text
You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The exact sequence matches the UniProt entry for NorA, whose curated annotation assigns EC 2.3.1.290 and describes the associated catalytic reaction. The annotation cites a publication, but the supplied excerpts do not independently establish that the reaction was experimentally measured on this exact protein.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [H1](#evidence-h1), [H4](#evidence-h4).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The long sequence is compatible with a modular polyketide synthase, which could suggest a broad enzyme class, but that does not distinguish the exact EC number among the options.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific identification as NorA in the spectinabilin biosynthetic system and its annotated catalytic reaction are needed to select EC 2.3.1.290.

**Reason**

> The sequence and choices do not provide enough biological context to infer the specific reaction or distinguish the closely related EC assignments. Doing so requires the protein-specific functional annotation or equivalent external evidence.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The reviewer evidence supports D for the sequence-matched protein; no other choice is supported by the supplied evidence. The limitation is lookup dependence, not evidence that multiple EC numbers apply.

### Important caveats

- The sequence match applies to UniProt accession B4ER92, but that accession was inferred from reviewer-only metadata and was not supplied to the evaluated model.
- The cited UniProt annotation is literature-supported curation; the excerpts alone do not establish direct experimental characterization of the exact sequence.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `B4ER92`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 83. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
