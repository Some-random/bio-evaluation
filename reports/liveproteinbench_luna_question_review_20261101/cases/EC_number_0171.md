You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The supplied sequence exactly matches the UniProt entry for a fungal aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, annotated EC 1.2.1.11. The annotation cites experimental evidence for the catalytic activity and reaction.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [H5](#evidence-h5).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> Sequence features may suggest a nucleotide-binding oxidoreductase and help disfavor the isomerase option, but those broad clues do not establish this protein’s substrate-specific catalytic activity or uniquely distinguish the exact EC number.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific identification as aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, supported here by curated annotation and cited catalytic-activity evidence.

**Reason**

> The sequence is supplied, but no biological context or functional evidence is provided that establishes its precise substrate and reaction. Recalling or retrieving this exact protein’s annotation would distinguish the choices; generic sequence heuristics alone do not.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The evidence supports one EC assignment for the matched protein, but the sequence-only input does not provide enough function-specific evidence to distinguish that assignment reliably from the alternatives.

### Important caveats

- The UniProt annotation is sequence-matched, and its EC assignment cites experimental evidence; the cited primary papers were not independently reviewed here.
- The annotation’s historical snapshot is known, but the author’s exact source snapshot is not.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `Q5KPK7`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 121. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
