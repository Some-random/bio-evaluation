You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Gene Ontology (GO) Molecular Function Prediction, which is to predict the fundamental activity of a protein at the molecular level, as defined by the Gene Ontology (GO) 'Molecular Function' branch. This describes the elemental tasks a protein performs, such as catalysis, transport, or binding to specific molecules. Based on the protein's amino acid sequence, you are to select the option that best describes its primary molecular function.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The supplied sequence exactly matches the 543-aa UniProt entry for Ipecac alkaloid beta-glucosidase 3. That entry reports beta-glucosidase activity and specific glucose-releasing reactions with experimental evidence attributed to a cited publication; its GO annotation is IDA. This supports choice A, while preserving that the evidence is an annotation reporting experimental findings rather than an independent review of the primary study.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [C6](#evidence-c6), [C7](#evidence-c7), [C8](#evidence-c8), [H3](#evidence-h3), [H4](#evidence-h4), [H5](#evidence-h5), [H6](#evidence-h6).

### Reasoning versus lookup: reasoning-supported

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence contains the conserved catalytic-motif pattern characteristic of family-1 glycoside hydrolases, including an ENG motif, which supports a glucoside-hydrolyzing enzyme. Among the choices, beta-glucosidase activity is the compatible broad function; the other options describe unrelated cofactor binding, peroxidase, or membrane mannosyltransferase activities.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The exact enzyme identity and experimentally tested substrate specificity are not supplied. Those would be needed to establish its particular physiological substrates, but are not necessary to favor the broad beta-glucosidase choice among these options.

**Reason**

> The sequence offers a defensible family-level biological signal that distinguishes the broad activity from the unrelated alternatives. The reviewer-only database identification and experimental annotation support the key, but are not being treated as information available to the evaluated model.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The choices describe distinct functions, and the sequence's glycoside-hydrolase motif pattern supports A over the alternatives. More specific substrate-level claims would require additional evidence, but the selected option is broad.

### Important caveats

- The sequence match and cited experimental annotation support the answer, but the primary study was not independently retrieved or validated here.
- The exact author data snapshot is unknown; the historical entry and current entry both match the supplied sequence.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `B6ZKM5`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 51. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
- Ontology names and EXACT synonyms match options mechanically; no answer-support judgment is made.
- Only is_a and part_of edges are used in supplied graph paths; all qualifiers and obsolete/replaced_by tags remain in literal source blocks.
- The ontology is newer than the benchmark repository commit; the exact author ontology snapshot is unknown.
- No matching term or path does not establish that an option is false.
