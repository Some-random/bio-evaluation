You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The exact 716-aa sequence matches the UniProt entry for this protein. That entry assigns EC 2.4.1.391 and links the catalytic-activity annotation to experimental evidence in a cited publication, supporting choice B.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [C6](#evidence-c6).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence may support broad functional-family inference, but the input gives no concrete basis for identifying the enzyme's specific beta-1,2-glucosyltransferase activity and distinguishing this complete EC number from the alternatives.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific experimentally characterized catalytic activity, classified as EC 2.4.1.391.

**Reason**

> The supported answer depends on a protein-specific functional annotation or experimental result absent from the question. Recognizing the sequence or recalling its database entry would be lookup or memorization, not reasoning from the supplied input.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The evidence supports one EC number, but the supplied sequence and choices alone do not provide a reliable way to distinguish it.

### Important caveats

- The evidence establishes the EC assignment for the sequence-matched UniProt entry; the author's exact source snapshot is unknown.
- The EC annotation is linked to experimental evidence in the cited publication, but that primary paper was not independently reviewed here.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `I0AIT9`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 55. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
