You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Active Site Prediction, which is to identify the key amino acid residues that form the active site of an enzyme. The active site is the specific region on the enzyme where a substrate binds and the chemical reaction is catalyzed. Based on the full protein sequence provided, you must select the option that correctly lists the amino acid residues (by their type and position) that constitute the enzyme's catalytic center.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The supplied sequence matches the annotated MKK1 sequence, and both current and historical UniProt records annotate position 362 as an active-site proton acceptor. This is a PROSITE-ProRule computational annotation, not direct experimental confirmation.

Cited evidence: [C5](#evidence-c5), [H3](#evidence-h3), [C4](#evidence-c4).

### Reasoning versus lookup: reasoning-supported

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence contains a protein-kinase domain with the conserved HRD catalytic motif. In kinases, the Asp in this motif is the catalytic base, making the corresponding Asp the plausible proton acceptor among the options.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> No external protein-specific fact is essential for a defensible motif-based choice; experimental validation of this exact residue is not supplied.

**Reason**

> The conserved kinase motif provides a biological basis to distinguish the catalytic proton-accepting residue from positions outside that motif. The database annotation supports the key but was not part of the evaluated input.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The conserved catalytic Asp in the kinase HRD motif provides a specific basis for selecting the proton-acceptor option.

### Important caveats

- The active-site annotation is computationally assigned through PROSITE-ProRule, not shown here to be experimentally measured.
- The sequence match is exact, but the author's source snapshot is unknown.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `A0A194VNL2`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 29. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
