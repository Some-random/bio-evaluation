You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Predicting Protein Cofactor, which is to identify the specific cofactor required for a given protein's catalytic activity. A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound or metallic ion that is essential for an enzyme's function. Based on the provided protein sequence, you will need to determine which of the multiple-choice options is the correct cofactor.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The sequence-matched UniProt annotation identifies NAD(+) as the cofactor and cites experimental evidence (ECO:0000269), including a note that NADP(+) cannot substitute. The linked paper is cited for cofactor evidence, though it was not independently reviewed here.

Cited evidence: [C5](#evidence-c5), [C6](#evidence-c6), [H4](#evidence-h4).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The N-terminal glycine-rich motif may suggest dinucleotide binding, but it does not establish this protein's cofactor specificity. The sequence alone does not provide a reliable distinction among the listed choices.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein's identity/function and experimentally established NAD(+) cofactor specificity are absent from the supplied input.

**Reason**

> The key is supported by sequence-matched database evidence, but that annotation and its experimental basis were reviewer-only. Recognizing the exact protein or retrieving its cofactor annotation would be needed to establish the answer.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The cited annotation specifically supports NAD(+) among the listed choices.

### Important caveats

- The current and archived UniProt records match the supplied sequence; the author's exact source snapshot is unknown.
- The experimental claim is reported through the database annotation and citation; the primary study was not independently validated here.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `A7GKX7`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 94. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
