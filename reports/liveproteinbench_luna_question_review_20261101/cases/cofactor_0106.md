| supported | lookup-dependent | format-valid AI review |

These labels are Luna’s original judgments. Source support and reasoning from the original input are separate questions. The benchmark key and original score are unchanged.

You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Predicting Protein Cofactor, which is to identify the specific cofactor required for a given protein's catalytic activity. A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound or metallic ion that is essential for an enzyme's function. Based on the provided protein sequence, you will need to determine which of the multiple-choice options is the correct cofactor.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The exact supplied sequence matches the UniProt entry annotated as binding one FMN per subunit, supporting choice A. However, the cofactor annotation is transferred by similarity from another UniProt protein (ECO:0000250), not direct experimental evidence for this sequence.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C5](#evidence-c5), [H4](#evidence-h4).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence alone does not provide a sufficiently definitive cofactor-binding signature to distinguish FMN from the listed alternatives; identifying the protein as a 4-nitrobenzoate reductase would help, but that identity is not supplied.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific annotation or experimental determination that this enzyme binds FMN is absent from the input.

**Reason**

> The key is supported by reviewer-only annotation, but that annotation was not supplied to the model. Exact-sequence recognition or recall of the protein's entry would be lookup or memorization, not reasoning from the provided evidence.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The supplied evidence does not establish another listed choice, though the input itself lacks enough information to distinguish the choices reliably.

### Important caveats

- The reviewer-only annotation matches the exact sequence but attributes the FMN annotation to similarity-based evidence rather than direct experimental evidence for this protein.
- The author’s source snapshot is unknown; a historical matching UniProt record also carried the FMN annotation.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `P0DXG6`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 3. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
