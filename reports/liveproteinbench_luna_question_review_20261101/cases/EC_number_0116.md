You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Luna’s full visible review

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The exact sequence matches a UniProt entry annotated as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit with EC 2.7.11.11. The EC assignment and catalytic reactions are supported by similarity transfer from UniProtKB:P17612 (ECO:0000250), rather than demonstrated here by direct experimental evidence on this protein.

Cited evidence: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [C6](#evidence-c6), [H2](#evidence-h2), [H4](#evidence-h4), [H5](#evidence-h5).

### Reasoning versus lookup: lookup-dependent

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence contains a protein-kinase catalytic domain, supporting a kinase classification and making the transferase and oxidoreductase choices poor fits. That broad inference does not establish the specific kinase subtype required to distinguish EC 2.7.11.11 from EC 2.7.11.24.

**Missing item-specific fact**

> The protein-specific identification or functional annotation as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, or equivalent evidence distinguishing it from other serine/threonine kinases.

**Reason**

> The exact four-part EC number depends on a subtype assignment not established by the supplied sequence and choices alone; recognizing or retrieving the protein-specific annotation would resolve it.

### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options named by Luna:** none.

> The reviewer-only sequence-matched annotation supports A. The input alone does not securely distinguish the two kinase subtypes, but that uncertainty does not make another option an established alternative.

### Important caveats

- The annotation is similarity-based, not direct experimental evidence for this exact protein.
- The historical sequence match is confirmed, but the author's exact source snapshot is unknown.

## Project source-check notes

These project-authored, AI-assisted checks assess specific source claims. They are not expert adjudication and do not replace Luna’s saved review or the author key.

No additional case-specific project note was recorded. Citation membership checks do not establish that every scientific argument is correct.

## Reviewer-only source evidence

**This source material was supplied only to the reviewer. It was absent from the original evaluated question.** An exact-sequence database match can support a key without establishing that the question can be answered by reasoning from its original input.

**Accession:** `G1X456`; identity was recovered from dataset image-path metadata and was absent from the evaluated model input.  
**Sequence applicability:** historical matched; current matched.  
**Historical cutoff:** 2026-05-07; selected entry version 68. The exact author source snapshot remains unknown.

- All evidence and source identity in this section are reviewer-only and were absent from the evaluated model input.
- UniProt annotations may be experimental, computational, or transferred by similarity; evidence codes and qualifiers are retained.
- The 2026-05-07 cutoff approximates the pinned repository date; the author data-construction date and exact source snapshot remain unknown.
- Selected source fields are excerpts; missing annotation is not evidence of falsehood. Primary papers were not comprehensively retrieved or independently validated.
