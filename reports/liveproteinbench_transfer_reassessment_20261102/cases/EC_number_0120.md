| Reviewer | Expected-answer support | Reasoning versus lookup |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-6 Luna | supported | reasoning-supported |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 | Unusable review | Unusable review |

The reviewers assess the question and its expected answer. Their agreement is not expert confirmation. An unusable review is an output failure, not a finding that the question is wrong.

You are an excellent scientist. Analyze the provided protein-related task carefully and choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

The current task is about Enzyme Commission (EC) Number Prediction, which is to predict the complete 4-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) number for a given protein. The EC number is a numerical classification that categorizes enzymes based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. You should select the most accurate EC number from the provided options based on the protein's sequence.. The inputs provided by the user for this task include:

* Protein Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein.
* Multiple Choices: Candidate answers for the protein-related question.

Please think step-by-step about this problem:
1. Analyze the protein sequence carefully.
2. Consider the biological context and function.
3. Evaluate each multiple-choice option.
4. Provide your reasoning process.
5. Finally, give your answer.

Provide your response in the following format:
1. reasoning: [Your detailed reasoning here]
2. answer: Your final answer, which should be "A", "B", "C" or "D".

## Reviewer assessments

## GPT-6 Luna

**Saved status:** `valid_review`.

### Expected-answer support: supported

> The supplied sequence exactly matches the source record, which assigns EC 4.2.1.183 and reports catalytic activity for the corresponding reactions with experimental evidence cited to a publication.

Citations as saved: [C1](#evidence-c1), [C4](#evidence-c4), [C5](#evidence-c5), [C6](#evidence-c6).

### Reasoning versus lookup: reasoning-supported

**Discriminating biological argument**

> The sequence is consistent with a plant CYP74-family cytochrome P450 enzyme. Transferable knowledge of CYP74 enzymes links this family to transformations of fatty-acid hydroperoxides, including divinyl ether synthase activity. Among the choices, EC 4.2.1.183 is the matching lyase-type activity; the isomerase and hydrolase alternatives are not a good fit, and EC 4.2.1.70 is not the relevant CYP74 activity.


**Missing item-specific fact**

Empty string, as saved.


**Reason**

> Family-level sequence recognition and knowledge of CYP74 reaction types provide a meaningful basis for distinguishing the offered EC number. This supports a probabilistic inference, though the sequence alone may not independently establish the precise reaction as directly as an assay or target annotation.


### Question ambiguity

**Multiple defensible options, exactly as saved:**

```json
[]
```

> The choices differ in reaction class, and the CYP74-family inference favors C; no other offered option is comparably supported.


### Important caveats

- The experimental support comes from reviewer-only source evidence and was not part of the original model input.
- CYP74-family enzymes can catalyze different related reactions, so family recognition alone is less conclusive for the exact EC number than target-specific functional evidence.
